# ZZ-fishing
ZZ-fishing is a software project where a user will be able to use a mobile application in order to register personal fishing catches. This will include a mobile application where the user can register with own credentials, add new fishing catches into a personal view on the application and get a list of one's own catches. A fishing catch represents an event of a fishing catch and information about the catch / event itself. The event involves information such as date, weather conditions, fishing location, fishing species, fishing lures and whether the fish were released or not. The purpose of the application is for the user to be able to see information about a specific catch, and see what conditions were current at the time, which can then be used for future catches.
